Disclaimer: Demo app.

Anthill is a liquid democracy inspired reputation system, people are organised into a binary tree, and everyone is assigned a reputation (number). 

The position does not directly affect the reputation. You get reputation by collecting secondary value votes. You can give anyone value votes above you in the tree, within a certain proximity. Similarly, you can receive value votes form anyone under you, in a certain proximity. 

To emphasise: value votes, and not position determines your reputation.

Also you can leave the tree, or move to unoccupied spots in the tree. 

Finally: if you have higher reputation than your parent in the binary tree, you can change positions with them, thus climbing the tree. 

This is the repo for the smart contracts.
